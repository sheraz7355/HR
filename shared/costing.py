"""Inventory costing engine.

Single source of truth for what a unit of stock COSTS at any point in time.
Every document that moves stock (purchase invoice, sales invoice, purchase
return, consumption, scrap, adjustment, stock take) must go through
``record_in`` / ``record_out`` so the StockLedger holds a complete history:

    IN  rows carry the actual acquisition cost (landed purchase cost).
    OUT rows carry the cost COMPUTED from the cost layers at issue time —
        never a price typed by the user and never the product's static
        cost_price.

That computed cost is what the calling voucher posts to the general ledger
(COGS, scrap loss, an employee's receivable account, ...), so receivables/
payables always reflect true historic cost.

HOW VALUATION WORKS
-------------------
Cost lives in StockLayer rows, not in a replay of the ledger. The two
valuation methods differ in exactly one place — what a RECEIPT does:

    FIFO              each receipt opens a new layer.
    weighted average  each receipt merges into the single open layer,
                      re-averaging its unit cost.

Issuing is identical under both: consume layers oldest-first at each layer's
own cost. Under weighted average there is only ever one open layer, so that
cost IS the running average.

Because issues decrement real layers rather than assuming a consumption
order, this invariant always holds:

    sum(layer.value_remaining) == ledger running_cost

Layer value is CARRIED, not recomputed from qty x unit_cost: every movement
of it is one of the same 2dp amounts the ledger moves in, so the two sides
cannot drift apart by rounding. StockLayer's docstring has the arithmetic.

WHY THAT MATTERS
----------------
Switching valuation method is a REVALUATION, not a re-interpretation of
history (this is what SAP's material ledger and NetSuite's cost
revaluation do):

    WA -> FIFO   the single open layer carries forward at book value;
                 later receipts open new layers.
    FIFO -> WA   remaining layers collapse into one at book value.

Both directions preserve book value exactly, so a method switch can never
change a cost that was already computed and posted. The old engine derived
FIFO layers by replaying OUT quantities against IN rows, which silently
assumed every past issue had consumed oldest-first; switching methods then
invented value (buy 10@10 + 10@20, sell 10 at avg 15, switch to FIFO ->
COGS 350 against purchases of 300). Layers make that unrepresentable.

TIME: DOCUMENT DATE, NOT KEYING ORDER
------------------------------------
Every ledger row carries ``txn_date`` -- the date of the document that moved
the stock. Layers are consumed in (txn_date, id) order. A document keyed in
order (the normal case) is costed on the fast path exactly as above. Two
things break the order, and both are handled by replaying the product's
history in date order (``_replay``):

    back-dating   a purchase dated last month, keyed after this month's sales.
                  In date order those sales could have drawn on it, so they
                  are re-costed as if it had been entered on time.
    reversal      unapproving an earlier document (to correct it, or because
                  it never happened). Later issues are re-costed from what is
                  left; re-approving the corrected document re-costs them
                  again around it.

Rows before the change are frozen -- nothing earlier can be affected by it.
Rows after it are re-costed. Every issue whose cost moves gets a
``StockCostAdjustment`` and a journal (shared/cost_adjustment.py) charging the
difference to the account the issue originally hit, so the inventory control
account keeps tying to the stock valuation and P&L carries the true cost.
A back-dated issue is refused if stock was not on hand AT ITS DATE, or if it
would leave a later issue uncovered.
